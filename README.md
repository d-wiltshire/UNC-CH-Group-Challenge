## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model will take in features from the database (using the "Sample_student_success_data_for_testing.csv" as a provisional database) and use them on predicted target values. For example, features in the provisional database include features like the percentage of English language learners, demographic information like race and gender, and economic information like the percentage of the cohort living under the poverty line. These can be used as features to predict a target variable such as "percentage dropped out of cohort" using supervised machine learning.

### Tools

The current strategy includes using Random Forest to determine feature importances in order to reduce the number of features in the database for accuracy in predicting the target.
