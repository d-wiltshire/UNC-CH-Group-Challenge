      <h1>NYC Student Success Predictions</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><b>Can demographic information be used to predict student success outcomes?</b></p>
        <p>The goal of this project was to assess and visualize the relationship of demographic factors (e.g., economic need) to student success metrics (e.g., graduation rate) for New York City high schools.</p>
        <p>Our team selected this topic because education is important to all the members of our group, and we are interested in learning more about the relationship between the demographics and resourcing of a school and its success outcomes.</p>
        <p>This project involved combining four datasets, each with information about NYC school demographics and/or success outcomes, in order to create visualizations depicting these relationships and assess machine learning models' ability to predict outcomes.</p>
