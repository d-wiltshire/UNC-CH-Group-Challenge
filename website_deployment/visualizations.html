             <p> The stories linked above depict relationships between demographic information and success outcomes for NYC high schools.</p>
             <p> In the visualizations in this section, each dot represents one school. For each school, the demographic and success information has been averaged from a series of cohorts: the visualizations are derived from the merged dataset that was created after <i>groupby</i> was used in Pandas on the various demographic and success metric features. That is to say, whereas the original datasets contained information about many cohorts over the years from a given school, that information was averaged, by school, to create one row per school for visualization.</p> 
             <p> The visualizations show strong relationships between various economic metrics, like the Economic Need Index, and success metrics like a school's dropout rate. Please view the stories above for more information, and please utilize the filtering features on the right of each visualization for more information.</p>
             <p> These visualizations were created in Tableau and are hosted in Tableau Public.</p>
