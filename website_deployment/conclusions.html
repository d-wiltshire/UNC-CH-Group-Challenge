            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p> With a percentage of less than 5%, we can conclude that demographics do not contribute to overall dropout rates. However, percentage of more than 80%, it is safe to conclude that poverty does play an effect into overall dropout rates.</p>
                <p> In conclusion, we have discovered that finding a concrete reason for drop out rates is complicated. While poverty does play a part in predicted drop out rates, factors such as teacher qualifications, school funding, and student involvement can also play a part in overall drop out rates. These factors were not considered due to the fact that our team did not have the data for them. </p>
                <p> For future analysis, some improvements that could be made would be to perform this analysis on multiple cities in America. Perhaps a more linear trend could be discovered if a plethora of city data on schools could be fed into the machine learning algorithm. Additionally, having an updated dataset would be of great help in making an official analysis.</p>
