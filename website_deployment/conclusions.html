            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p> With the R-Squared value of 99%, we can say that the data best fit the regression model.
                    The adjusted R-squared penalizes the R-squared formula based on the number of variables; therefore, a higher adjusted score means most of the variables are contributing to our model's R-squared properly.
                    After looking at the p values, some of the demographic features (Asian, black, Hispanic, native Americans, white), total cohort, regentsâ€™ data, and the number of English language learners are significant as they are less than 0.05. so, we can reject the null hypothesis that these features make a difference in the student dropout rate.
                    Poverty features (poverty number, Economic Need Index) are not significant as they are higher than 0.05. so, we can conclude that these features make a difference in the student dropout rate.</p>
                <p> In conclusion, we have discovered that finding a concrete reason for drop out rates is complicated. While poverty does play a part in predicted drop out rates, factors such as teacher qualifications, school funding, and student involvement can also play a part in overall drop out rates. These factors were not considered due to the fact that our team did not have the data for them. </p>
                <p> For future analysis, some improvements that could be made would be to perform this analysis on multiple cities in America. Perhaps a more linear trend could be discovered if a plethora of city data on schools could be fed into the machine learning algorithm. Additionally, having an updated dataset would be of great help in making an official analysis.</p>
